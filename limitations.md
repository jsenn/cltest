* No graph, as requested
  - In fact, no JavaScript of any kind (beyond the stub for the graph)

* I used the standard "$" dollar sign, but the .psd has a different symbol

* I only went by the .psd file, which is considerably different from the .png

* From the design it seems that the "testimonial" section should be a carousel,
  which I didn't implement

* There's an annoying horizontal overflow, which is due to some Bootstrap layout
  weirdness

* Because I wasn't able to extract the embedded fonts from the .psd file
  (are there any?) the fonts don't match exactly
